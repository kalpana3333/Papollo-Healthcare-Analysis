🌟Exciting News! 🌟

I’m thrilled to share my latest project – Papollo Healthcare Analysis! 



🔍 Project Overview:

This Power BI dashboard analyzes healthcare data for Papollo Healthcare, focusing on patient admissions, diagnoses, doctor assignments, bed occupancy, and billing insights.



🌟Key Insights:

Viral Infection is the most common diagnosis, contributing to the highest billing (53M). Private beds have the highest occupancy (3.6K), followed by General (2.4K) and ICU (1.2K). The billing and insurance amounts show a close correlation across different diagnoses.

Doctor workload is evenly distributed, with each handling around 1.02K patients.



🌟Conclusion: The analysis helps in understanding healthcare trends, patient billing, and hospital resource allocation. These insights can optimize bed management, doctor assignments, and financial planning.
